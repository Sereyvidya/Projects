# ü§ñ APEye: Malware Family Classification from API Calls

This project explores techniques to classify malware into families based on their API call behaviors. It includes preprocessing, deep learning, and traditional machine learning approaches. The project also serves as a learning experience to demonstrate ML concepts acquired in class.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `data/APICalls.txt`: Contains a list of all unique API calls.
- `data/malwares/`: Contains 7 subfolders, one for each malware family:
  - `adload`, `bancos`, `onlinegames`, `vbinject`, `vundo`, `winwebsec`, `zwangi`
  - Each subfolder contains text files representing individual malware samples.
  - Each file contains a sequence of API calls made by that malware sample.
- `Classifiers.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing preprocessing technique, deep learning, and machine learning pipelines for classification modeling.

## üß™ Approaches Explored

### ‚è≥ Preprocessing

- **Integer Encoding**: Each unique API call is mapped to an integer.
- **Word2Vec Embeddings**: API calls are treated like words, and embeddings are generated to represent sequences.
- **Count Vectorization**: For better performance, API call frequencies per sample are collected as feature vectors (like a document-term matrix).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Models

- **Deep Learning**:
  - CNN
  - RNN
  - LSTM  
  *(Results: Did not perform well.)*

- **Classical Machine Learning**:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression  
  *(Results: Performed significantly better with count-based features.)*

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Copy the entire `APEye` folder into your Google Drive.
2. Open `Classifiers.ipynb` in Google Colab.
3. Set the `PATH` variable to project's directory. For example:
   ```python
   # Change this to your own project path on Google Drive
   PATH = "/content/drive/MyDrive/APEye"
   ```
4. Run `Classifiers.ipynb` from start to finish. 
5. Modify models parameters and preprocessing steps as needed to experiment with performance.

## üß† Thought Process

Initially, the project assumed that **the sequence of API calls matters** in classifying malware families. To preserve this sequential information:

- API calls were **integer-encoded** and **Word2Vec embeddings** were generated.
- These sequence-preserving encodings were then fed into **deep learning models** like CNN, RNN, and LSTM, which are known for modeling sequential data.

However, these models **did not yield effective results**.

Based on that, the approach shifted:

- The focus moved to **counting the frequency** of each API call in a sample (regardless of order), forming feature vectors (like a document-term matrix).
- These were then used as input to **traditional machine learning models** ‚Äî SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression ‚Äî which significantly outperformed the deep learning methods.
