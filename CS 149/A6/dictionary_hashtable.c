/**
 * The reason for using a hashtable is to store the commands in hash slots by their pids.
 * This way you can lookup a command by a pid and retrieve all the info you need:
 *  command, index (this index means the line number in the text file you read),
 *  start time, and anything else you might need.
 *
 * A hashtable (as you might remember from CS146)
 * has slots and each slot contains a linked list of nodes 
 * (these are the entries that contain all the command info).
 * Thus the hashtable (see hashtab array variable below) is 
 * implemented as an array of nlists. Each array position is a 
 * slot and a linked list of nlist nodes starts at each array slot. 
 * Each array position is a hahstable slot.
 *
 * You find the hashtable slot for a pid by using a hash function, 
 * which will map the pid to a hashtable slot (array position).
 *
 * You can copy this entire code directly in your .c code. No need to have
 * many files. 
 *
 *
 * This nlist is a node, which stores one command's info in the hashtable.
 * TODO: You will need to adopt this code a little.
 *
 * The char *name and char *defn you can remove.
 * The nlist *next field is a pointer to the next node in the linked list.  
 * There is one hashtable slot in each array position, 
 * consequently there is one linked list of nlists under a hashtable slot.
