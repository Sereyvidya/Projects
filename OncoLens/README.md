# üß¨ OncoLens: Predictive Modeling for Cancer Outcomes

This project analyzes clinical cancer patient data and models treatment outcomes using machine learning. It aims to demonstrate how ML techniques can be applied in cancer research to uncover patterns in patient survivability and treatment response. The project also serves as a learning experience to deepen practical skills in data analysis and machine learning within a biomedical context.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `DataProcessing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the clinical dataset (`clinical.json`). This includes handling structured patient data such as diagnoses, treatments, follow-ups, and demographics.
- `Models.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing machine learning pipelines for classification modeling.
- `clinical.json`: A structured dataset containing de-identified clinical records, including patient demographics, disease types, staging, treatments, outcomes, and follow-ups.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Copy the entire OncoLens folder into your Google Drive. 
2. Open `DataProcessing.ipynb` and set the PATH variable to project's directory.
3. Run `DataProcessing.ipynb` to load and clean the data.
4. Open `Models.ipynb` and set the PATH variable to 
project's directory.
5. Run `Models.ipynb` to train and evaluate classification models.
6. Modify model parameters and preprocessing steps as needed to experiment with performance.

## üí° Example Use Cases

OncoLens could be used to:
- Predict recurrence likelihood based on initial diagnosis and treatment.
- Evaluate survival trends across cancer types.
- Study treatment effectiveness (e.g., chemo vs. immunotherapy).

## üôè Acknowledgements

- `clinical.json` dataset was obtained by applying filters on data from the National Cancer Institute Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
- This project was completed in collaboration with Victoria Vo and Jerrison Wong with guidance from Professor James Casaletto.
